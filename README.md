# Identifying-and-Recommending-Best-Restaurants-by-Rating-in-Python-Tableau.
DESCRIPTION

A restaurant consolidator is looking to revamp the B2C portal using intelligent automation tech. This requires a different matrix to identify the star restaurants and generate recommendations. To make sure an effective model can be achieved, it is important to understand the behavior of the data in hand.

There are 2 datasets, data and Country-Code. Dataset data has 19 attributes and Country-Code has two attributes.

You are required to determine certain matrices to identify the star restaurants and generate recommendations.

Step to perform:

Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data :

Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings as the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.

Based on the findings from the previous questions, identify duplicates and remove them

Performing EDA:

Explore the geographical distribution of the restaurants and identify the cities with the maximum and minimum number of restaurants

Restaurant franchising is a thriving venture. So, it is very important to explore the franchise with most national presence

Find out the ratio between restaurants that allow table booking vs. those that do not allow table booking

Find out the percentage of restaurants providing online delivery

Calculate the difference in number of votes for the restaurants that deliver and the restaurants that do not deliver

What are the top 10 cuisines served across cities?

What is the maximum and minimum number of cuisines that a restaurant serves? Also, which is the most served cuisine across the restaurant for each city?

What is the distribution cost across the restaurants?

How ratings are distributed among the various factors?

Explain the factors in the data that may have an effect on ratings. For example, number of cuisines, cost, delivery option, etc.

Dashboarding:

Visualize the variables using Tableau to help user explore the data and create a better understanding of the restaurants to identify the ‘’star’’ restaurant

Demonstrate the variables associated with each other and factors to build a dashboard
